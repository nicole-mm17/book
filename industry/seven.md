Even in you're not a physicist, there is plenty to see and do above and below ground at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), in Geneva, Switzerland. Home to the world's largest experiment, on what is arguably the world's largest machine, CERN is a very inspiring place to visit. Consequently, CERN and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) feature in many guidebooks like [The Geek Atlas](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-geek-atlas/9780596802257/) [1], the [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cern), [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/switzerland/geneva/attractions/cern/a/poi-sig/409720/360817) and [Tripadvisor.com](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188057-d242814-Reviews-CERN-Geneva.html). So what can you actually see and do at CERN?

1. **Get a well paid engineering job**. Good news for engineers, there are loads of jobs at CERN. What better way to explore a place than to work there? If you're a student see [careers.cern/students](https://careers.cern/students) for details on summer internships and year long technical student programs.  üì¢ *KLAXON: the next application deadline for summer internships is 31st January 2020.* üì¢ If you have already graduated, take a look at the [CERN Fellowships](https://stfc.ukri.org/funding/fellowships/cern-fellowships/) and the doctoral student program. There are also plenty of opportunities for more experienced engineers described at [careers.cern/professionals](https://careers.cern/professionals) too. CERN's mission is to ‚Äú[unite people from all over the world to push the frontiers of science and technology, for the benefit of all](https://communications.web.cern.ch/strategy/communications-architecture-vision-mission-and-themes)‚Äù. Part of that means providing opportunities for people from [CERN's 23 member states](https://home.cern/about/who-we-are/our-governance/member-states) to learn new skills at CERN and take them back to their home country. For every research physicist at CERN, there are ten engineers. [2] To run their experiments, physicists rely on massive, novel and a very precise network of machines made with millions of parts, both moving and stationary. You need an army of engineers to build, test, run and develop such a complex machine, for example:
    + Mechanical engineers develop heating & cooling systems and mechatronics (there are [quite a few robots at CERN](https://home.cern/news/news/engineering/meet-cern-robots))
    + Materials engineers test novel materials, metals, magnets, microscopes, superconductors, vacuums, X-ray diffraction and apply radiochemistry
    + Software and hardware engineers develop applications, virtualised infrastructure, distributed computing and databases using a wide range of programming and scripting languages. These applications manage data in one of the most highly demanding computing environments in the research world
    + Electrical and electronic engineers work on energy distribution, signal processing, microelectronics and radiofrequency technology
    + Civil engineers and geotechnical engineers develop structures, roads, drainage, both above (and under) ground to accommodate all of the above
    + There are non-engineering jobs too, in administration [careers.cern/AdminStudent-projects](https://careers.cern/AdminStudent-projects) and Applied Physics (obviously)

So CERN is full of engineers of every flavour. But if you're not a physicist or an engineer looking for a job, there is still plenty to see and do. So let's restart our [listicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle) again: seven things to do at CERN if you're not a physicist, an engineer or job seeker:

1. **Watch cosmic rays arrive from outer space**: There are two permanent exhibitions which can be visited without booking and they both have free entry. One is housed in the aesthetically pleasing [Globe of Science and Innovation](https://visit.cern/globe) (GoSI) and is called the [Universe of Particles](https://visit.cern/exhibitions/universe-particles). Another is opposite the GoSI and called [Microcosm](http://microcosm.web.cern.ch/en). There‚Äôs plenty to see in both exhibits, including film projections, [spark chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_chamber) showing [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) and¬†[cloud chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber) which allow you to visualise [ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation).
1. **Wander the Immeasurable with Gayle Hermick**:¬†Right outside the GoSI, sits an impressive sculpture¬†made of 15 tonnes¬†of twisted¬†steel, stretched out over 37 metres in length and 11 metres¬†up into the air. Covered in mathematical equations describing physical laws, the sculpture tells the story of Physics from [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia) and [Ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece) up to present day Higgs Boson and beyond. It's a beautiful work of art to comtemplate by [Gayle Hermick](https://www.gaylehermick.com/cern).
1. **Crunch numbers using Einstein's famous equation**:¬†You can‚Äôt visit CERN without crunching some numbers. Many people will be familiar¬†with Einstein's famous equation of [mass‚Äìenergy equivalence *E=mc¬≤*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence). What this¬†means is that energy can be converted into mass (and vice versa) and the ‚Äúexchange rate‚Äù (*c¬≤*) is a very large number - the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light) squared. So, you can turn a small about of mass into a HUGE amount of energy. Armed with your¬†[handy¬†mass‚Äìenergy calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/emc2), you can crunch numbers, for example 1 kg = 90,000,000,000,000,000 Joules.
1. **Thank the technology mothership**: CERN is widely known as [the birthplace of the Web](https://home.cern/science/computing/where-web-was-born), which we should all be thankful for. Many other technologies can trace their origin to CERN. [Bent Stumpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Stumpe) and his colleagues [developed the first touchscreens](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1248908?ln=en) as early as 1973. [3,4] Cloud computing (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure etc) have some of their roots in [Grid Computing developed at CERN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj8ZNgnzSSU) too. [5] Key pieces of widely used open-source software like [Ceph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceph_(software)) and [OpenStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack) have been co-developed at CERN. Where would we be without massive international collaborations? Find out more about how investment creates a positive impact on society through knowledge transfer, spin outs, startups and more at [kt.cern](https://kt.cern). Many of these projects have an impact far beyond physics in areas such as medicine and consumer electronics. Thank you technology mothership.
1. **Boggle at Big Data**: Data speaks louder than words. Here is some random data for your mind to boggle on:
      + When switched on, some of the LHC detectors track up to¬†40 million events *per second*.  
      + The LHC Grid computing generates¬†30 [petabytes (10¬π‚Åµ bytes)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte) per year, with 300 petabytes of data permanently archived in its tape libraries as of October 2018.
      + The big loop underground is 27km long. Travelling very fast, close to the speed of light, a proton laps the circuit 11,000 times *every second*.
      + There are¬†100,000 scientists from over 100 countries working at CERN  
      + More boggling can be done in the [CERN data centre](https://home.cern/science/computing/data-centre), especially the key facts and figures. [6]
1. **Contribute to the Grid**: Talking of data, physicists from all over the world work on data produced by the experiments. This requires supercomputers, very High Performance Computing (HPC) and Grid computing that no single machine can provide. This is why the [Worldwide LHC Computing Grid](https://wlcg-public.web.cern.ch/) (WLCG) exists. With the improvements of the LHC, more and more computing power is required to crunch the data. Anyone can contribute by joining in the [LHC@home](https://lhcathome.cern.ch/lhcathome/) project. Who knows? Maybe you can be a part of the discovery of the new mysterious particle or the proof that physicists have been struggling with for decades. CERN's Grid builds on volunteered resources provided via the [Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Open_Infrastructure_for_Network_Computing) (BOINC) middleware.
1. **Book a free tour**: While the two free permanent exhibitions require no booking, the free tours offer much more and are typically given by knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff. You can learn a lot from the permanent exhibitions, but a tour guide brings the place to life. Tours fill up quickly and provide access to restricted parts of CERN, such as the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern/discover/about), [mission control](https://visit.cern/ccc), [CMS cavern](https://visit.cern/cms-service-cavern), [synchro-cyclotron](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/synchrocyclotron) and [CERN data centre](https://home.cern/science/computing). [6] The cyclotron tells the story of CERN from 1957, when the first particle accelerator arrived in pieces on the back of a few lorries. Today, it spans 27 km of France and Switzerland. How did that happen? Using lights and projectors, the exhibition brings the story to life in an illuminating way. At the time of writing, limited underground visits are possible as we are in the middle of the [long shutdown 2](https://lhc-commissioning.web.cern.ch/lhc-commissioning/schedule/LHC-long-term.htm) (LS2), which means tunnels are accessible, but you'll need to book a tour. [7]

If you ever get the chance to [visit.cern](http://visit.cern/), it is well worth it. CERN is a truly inspiring place that demonstrates what can be achieved when thousands of people collaborate on a shared vision.
<!--etc. I‚Äôm told the¬†control centre is fun, and obviously it would be great to see some of the detector hardware up close, but you can only do this when it is turned off.¬†I‚Äôve been lucky in that all my tour guides have been technical students and their managers, thanks have some tour guides to show me around,
